# Museum Project Using Python

A Python-based project designed to simulate or manage operations of a museum. This project is ideal for educational purposes, demonstrating object-oriented programming, data management, and user interaction in Python.

## Overview

The **Museum Project Using Python** provides a structured approach to handling various aspects of a museum, such as managing exhibits, tracking visitors, and maintaining records. The project can serve as a foundation for learning Python, developing similar management systems, or expanding into a more comprehensive application.

## Features

- Exhibit and artifact management
- Visitor tracking and registration
- Ticketing and entry logging (if implemented)
- Data storage and retrieval (file-based or database)
- Command-line or graphical user interface (depending on your implementation)
- Modular, extensible codebase for easy expansion

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Optional] Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Museum-Project-Using-Python.git
   cd Museum-Project-Using-Python
   ```

2. **[Optional] Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**  
   *(If your project uses any external packages, list them in `requirements.txt`)*
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Run the main Python script to start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

*(Replace `main.py` with the entry point of your application if different.)*

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the museum system.
